<h2>Spring 3.1 Kickstart Sample Application</h2>

<p>
    This application was originally created by <a href="http://jroller.com/buggybean">Thomas Risberg</a>
    and <a href="http://raibledesigns.com">Matt Raible</a> for their <strong>Spring 2.0 Kickstart</strong>
    presentation at <a href="http://springforward2006.com">Spring Forward 2006</a>.  
    <br/><br/>
    It has been upgraded to use some of Spring 3.1's latest features, including Profiles, Caching and Servlet 3.0.
